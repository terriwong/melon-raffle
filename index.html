Hello,

We've got a lot of people working on different versions
of our new app for processing customers! People just love
melons! I'm not sure what an &quot;environment&quot; is (sounds like
one of those things lefty nonprofits worry about), but,
according to CTO Today! Magazine, we need to make sure that
developers are setting up their environment correctly
to manage libraries and split up files as needed.

Get up to speed on implementing &quot;virtual environments&quot;
on this project so we don't have any conflicts or missing
requirements. Make sure that you have a .gitignore so your
environment doesn't end up on Github. (Apparently, Github
is a &quot;company&quot;).

We just poached Squysh's 16-year-old wonderkid engineering
manager to optimize our work process. He says that everyone
should install bpython as well. You won't need it for this project,
but try it out so you know how to do it later. Apparently, you'll use
something called &quot;pip&quot;. But do this inside of your &quot;virtual environment&quot;.
Oh, and my new golf buddy says you should &quot;freeze&quot; this, so someone
else can set things up the same later. <em>Pip</em>? <em>Freeze</em>? <em>Virtual environment</em>?
This all is starting to sound like some sort of science fiction musical,
if you ask me! But we're paying a lot for this advice so make
it happen.

See you next week,

Mel

P.S. I'm not clear what this &quot;virtual environment&quot; is, but
     don't think we're going to buy you any of those fancy
     goggles. All of our discretionary income has gone into
     my new shiny titanium golf clubs.

Oh and make sure you take a look at our app's code.
There are a couple of bugs keeping things from working
just right. Take care of those.

And one last thing,

We're currently running a temporary promotion where
customers are automatically entered into a raffle for a free
melon. As my mother used to say, &quot;The only thing better than
a melon is a FREE MELON!&quot;. Since this isn't a part of our
normal operations, we don't want that code with our regular
scripts.

There's a script in this file for processing raw customer info
and then choosing a random customer. Split the file into three files:
<strong>customer.py</strong> should contain our customer class
<strong>customer_info.py</strong> should take our customer data and create instances
for each customer.
<strong>melon_raffle.py</strong> should randomly select a customer and print their name
and contact information.
